Let's face it, the new(er) MacBook Pro is trash. I have one for work that I use pretty much every day, and I honestly prefer my 2015 MacBook Pro. There are a few things that I like, but more I dislike, and I'll outline them here.

## The Good

### Battery Life

I'm not sure if it's just that my old laptop is old, but the new MacBook Pro has excellent battery life. 

### Speed

I mean this is pretty much a given for newer computers, but it's _way_ faster than the old generation. The new PCI storage is nice and snappy, even compared to an SSD.

### The Screen
The retina display on the newer device is beautiful. Enough said.


## The Bad

### Ports

I know Apple is trying to be "forward-thinking" with nuking all the useful ports, but after 3 years of this device being on the market, USB-C is still not enough. With the old model we had USB-A, HDMI, and SD card, and now we have "dongle hell". Not only is it a pain to bring dongles with you everywhere, the dongles are _expensive_. I use my SD card reader all the time for offloading pictures from my camera, and the HDMI port is super useful for low-latency screencasting. I understand not having USB-A, but let's be honest - thumb drives are still primarily USB-A, and so is pretty much everything else USB-connected.

### The Death of MagSafe

I think MagSafe was my favorite part of the MacBook line, and we know Steve Jobs was a huge fan too. OK, so you can plug in your USB-C charging cable on either side of the device - who cares? Do you know how many times my USB power adapter comes _slightly_ out of the port and it stops charging? Answer - multiple times daily. MagSafe was a really nice feature to have with children, it's saved my old MacBook countless times from a dive onto the floor.

### TouchBar

What. a. gimmick. The touchbar has honestly caused more problems for me than it's worth. I just recently figured out how to remove all of the buttons on it when in Chrome, which was pretty much necessary with the amount of times I accidentally hit the "back" button and lost form data on a page. I want my F-key row back with physical buttons. I know they made that optional on the 13" model, but I also want it back on the 15" model. 

### The Escape Key

As a developer that uses vim _all the time_, losing the escape key was especially painful. Do you know how dumb it feels to tap the escape key? Do you know how awful it is that the escape key is now offset from the side of the keyboard for literally no reason? I could have included this in the touchbar section, but this is annoying enough to me that it warranted its own call-out.

### The Price
Yes, MacBook Pros are expensive, but $2500 for an entry-level 15" laptop _come on_. I love Apple products and their tight integration with each other, but when you can get a similarly spec'ed 15" laptop from other vendors for $1000, this is just a blatant cash grab. OSX is _by far_ the superior OS on the market, I just wish there was a reasonably priced way to get it with a 15"+ screen. The last time I bought a MacBook it was refurbished, but even then it was only to $1800. The new model refurbs are still $2039+ which is insane when prices on components are only going down.


## What's Next

I hear there's a 16" Macbook Pro on the horizon, although I also heard it's getting postponed. I sincerely hope that they follow through with the larger form-factor. I'm not too hopeful about Apple reversing course on these bad design decisions, but at least a larger screen would help. My laptop is getting old - 4 years is a long time for a laptop, even for a MacBook - and I'm holding out hope that the next MacBook will suck less. 

I will admit one thing, despite its flaws I would still buy the new MacBook Pro over a Windows laptop any day. However, if I'm as thoroughly displeased with the options available when it comes time to buy my next laptop, a ChromeBook might be an option.
